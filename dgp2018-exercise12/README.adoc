|===

Obviously, the uniform remeshing works only for smaller target lengths because for larger target lengths (and thus less triangles) the specific geometry cannot reproduced.
Hence, it is hard to fit to parts with a higher curvature.
This can be best seen in the uniform remeshing for target lengths and 0.75 and 1.
However, with uniform remeshing there are some problems with ceratin parts like the earseven for a target length of 0.25.

The adaptive remeshing even works for a target length of 1. Although not every geometric information is perfectly preserved, the shape stays highly comprhensible.
